LoE (LandOfElves) is a blizzlike world database for the ArcEmu WoW
server emulator.
It's based on WhyDB (thanks to them for their work) but with new
updates.

If you set up an ArcEmu server for your first time you need a world
database that contains all the basic information about NPCs,
gameobjects, items, spells, quests and much more.
